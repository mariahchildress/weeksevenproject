    <h2>My Idea</h2>

    <p>The idea for this trip came to me in May of last year.  I was a tired, burnt out teacher needing a vacation. I decided to go to Disneyland!</p>

    <p>I decided that I could make this a quick trip.  I would fly out on a Saturday morning, spend Sunday at Disneyland, Monday at Disney's California Adventure, then fly home on Tuesday.</p>

    <p>I was able to schedule this so that I could meet up with my parents, who were on a cross country vacation.</p>

    <h3>This was my plan, and eventually I was able to stick with this:</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Fly into LAX on July 10th</li>
        <li>Spend the day at Disneyland on July 11th</li>
        <li>Mom and dad meet me in Anaheim that night</li>
        <li>Spend the day at Disney California Adventure on July 12th</li>
        <li>Mom and dad continue on their trip on July 13th and I fly home the same day</li>
    </ol>
